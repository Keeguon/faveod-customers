# Faveod customers

This application is a just a mini-application which was requested as part of an interview process. It basically allows to fetch a list of customers or a specific customer using its name using SOAP

## Dependencies

* Rails 3.x
* PostgreSQL

## Precisions

The application uses [wash_out](https://github.com/roundlake/wash_out) to provide the different SOAP actions. Those were then tested using Savon (more on this below).

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the following commands:

```
$ bundle update
$ createuser -s faveod
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
```

Now it's time to create some records either manually or using the rails console. Once you're done run the following:

```
$ bundle exec unicorn_rails -p 3000
```

Rails server should be running using unicorn now all you have to do is perform SOAP requests using some clients, you can use [Savon](http://savonrb.com/) for Ruby.
